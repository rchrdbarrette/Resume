# Resume

Summary: 

I am a full stack Software Engineer with 20 years of experience designing highly scalable desktop, web and mobile applications primarily on the .NET platform.  I am flexible concerning technologies an am familiar with many languages and platforms. I am very comfortable with Agile/SCRUM SDLC methodologies and have implemented and taught them to teams. I am experienced with Application Lifecycle Management and am a proponent of continual process improvement.

I have worked on many large and small scale web sites including Amazon.com, Bing.com and Servpro.com to name a few.  Recently, I have been a camp worker for Summertide Resort and Marina in Tahuya, WA.  As a camp worker, I was the technical support and Web developer where I got the pleasure of creating the Summertide website.  For a sample of my recent work that I was the only one involved I invite you to please view summertideresort.com.  As you are aware a website is always a work in progress and I continue to implement new features.

My wife and I are currently working at a camp resort and I would like to find a job that I can do remotely and we can continue seeing this beautiful country we live in.  So working remotely would be a win-win situation.  I would be able to continue traveling with my wife, while finding new inspiration for my work as a software engineer.

Please contact me via email (rchrdbarrette@gmail.com) anytime.  I would be available for a Skype interview at your convenience. I look forward to hearing from you and if you think I would be a good fit!
